# RSD-as-a-service

## Our mission: To promote the visibility, impact and reuse of research software

This repo contains the new RSD-as-a-service implementation

## Building

The program can easily be built with `docker-compose`. Each service builds the image using specific version (see docker-compose.yml file). Ensure that the version number is increased in the `docker-compose.yml` file when the source code of that service is changed.

### Environment variables

The environment variables should be stored in .env file, which is automatically loaded by docker-compose. To validate loading of env variables use `docker-compose config`. More info about use of enviroment variables in docker-compose is available at [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/)

- copy the file `.env.example` to `.env` file at the root of the project

```bash
# from project root dir
cp .env.example .env
```

- `provide missing values in .env file (secrets)`
- build local images

```bash
# from project root dir
docker-compose build
```

## Running locally

Run the command `docker-compose up`.

```bash
# from project root dir
docker-compose up
```

The application can be viewed on http://localhost

### Frontend with hot-module-replacement (HMR)

To run frontend in the development mode with the hot-module-replacement (HMR) you should start additional instance of the frontend which will be available at http://localhost:3000

```bash
# navigate to frontend folder
cd frontend
# install dependencies
yarn install
# start fe in dev mode
yarn dev
```

More information about frontend setup is [available in the frontend readme file](/frontend/README.md).

## Clear/remove data (reset)

To clear the database, if the database structure has changed or you need to run data migration again, run the command:

```bash
docker-compose down --volumes
```

## Data migration

A data migration script is available to migrate data from the legacy RSD to the new one:

- run current RSD solution using `docker-compose up` from the root of the project
- run the migration script using docker-compose file in the data-migration folder

```bash
# navigate to data-migration folder
cd data-migration
# run data migration docker-compose file
docker-compose up
```

More information about [data migration is avaliable here](data-migration/README.md).
